Created a Machine Learning Model using GradientBoostingRegressor to predict the final positions of drivers in the belgian grand prix race. I have trained this model with last 4 years(2021-2014) of data which includes their performance statistics, grid positions, team and driver's performance at the track, weather etc. This is the initial phase of the model and I will be applying many changes in this later on.
